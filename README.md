![Rotating Sphere Demo](/rotating-sphere-demo.gif)

This project has a few goals, I will just mention a few for the moment until certain other aspects of this repository are brought up to speed. I promise I will not wait too long to do this, contrary to substantial evidence suggesting otherwise. **In other words,** this repo is not self-contained as of initial commit 2/3/20. It is being built apart from a working project that is bogged down by disorganization, memory issues, and other beautiful inefficiencies. Anyways...

This is not meant to be a tutorial for anyone, however, I do hope for this to be a bridge for those with a similar background as myself. Having jumped into a handful of Metal tutorials, there was only one which seemed to communicate the main ideas, the fundamentals, etc. in a way (for myself) to easily understand. Thus the purpose of this particular repo is to lay down a basic foundation for a Metal app so that a person seeking to get going with Metal without the desire or time to trudge through the murky swamps for something simple and concrete. This being said, the handful of tutorials I mentioned earlier were incredibly useful for myself and will likely be very useful to anyone seeking to get started, and so I will link those (in an upcoming commit ;0).

The app (though not yet) can generate a cube or a sphere. I hope to do much more than this, but making more complicated objects will take a bit of time on my part. I will also write some of my own thoughts and words on my understanding of what is going on (again, more on this in upcoming commits...). 

Unfortunately, I have little to no experience in resource management, etc, and so (when I do push some more code) there are some performance issues. I hope somehow these can be remedied over time. It'd be nice to provide a simple app which isn't broken all over the place. 

That's all for now. Will update this more this week. - 2/3/20
