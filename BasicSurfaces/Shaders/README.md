### Algorithm used in the generation of a sphere

The algorithm I use here comes directly from a random act of knowledge by
Professor Markus Deserno of CMU, a list of which can be found by following
[https://www.cmu.edu/biolphys/deserno/random_acts_of_knowledge.html](Random Acts of Knowledge).
For convenience I am including the pdf here too.
